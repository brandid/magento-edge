## WTF is this?

This is a module to connect the amazing Edge plugin to your local Magento install.

It provides you an easy on/off switch to enable/disable the script from appearing in your site, useful to keep it on for local installs, and turning it off for live.

## WTF is Edge?

Edge is an amazing plugin allowing you to edit Sass in Sublime Text 2 (other editors coming soon) and see the results in your browser in real-time!

BRANDiD built a module so you can use it in your Magento projects.
